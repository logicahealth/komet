/**
 * An advanced hash table supporting configurable garbage collection semantics of keys and values, optional
 * referential-equality, full concurrency of retrievals, and adjustable expected concurrency for updates.
 *
 * This table is designed around specific advanced use-cases. If there is any doubt whether this table is for
 * you, you most likely should be using
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} instead.
 *
 * This table supports strong, weak, and soft keys and values. By default keys are weak, and values are
 * strong. Such a configuration offers similar behavior to {@link java.util.WeakHashMap}, entries of this
 * table are periodically removed once their corresponding keys are no longer referenced outside of this
 * table. In other words, this table will not prevent a key from being discarded by the garbage collector.
 * Once a key has been discarded by the collector, the corresponding entry is no longer visible to this table;
 * however, the entry may occupy space until a future table operation decides to reclaim it. For this reason,
 * summary functions such as {@code size} and {@code isEmpty} might return a value greater than the observed
 * number of entries. In order to support a high level of concurrency, stale entries are only reclaimed during
 * blocking (usually mutating) operations.
 *
 * Enabling soft keys allows entries in this table to remain until their space is absolutely needed by the
 * garbage collector. This is unlike weak keys which can be reclaimed as soon as they are no longer referenced
 * by a normal strong reference. The primary use case for soft keys is a cache, which ideally occupies memory
 * that is not in use for as long as possible.
 *
 * By default, values are held using a normal strong reference. This provides the commonly desired guarantee
 * that a value will always have at least the same life-span as it's key. For this reason, care should be
 * taken to ensure that a value never refers, either directly or indirectly, to its key, thereby preventing
 * reclamation. If this is unavoidable, then it is recommended to use the same reference type in use for the
 * key. However, it should be noted that non-strong values may disappear before their corresponding key.
 *
 * While this table does allow the use of both strong keys and values, it is recommended to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap}
 * for such a configuration, since it is optimized for that case.
 *
 * Just like {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap}, this class obeys the same functional
 * specification as {@link java.util.Hashtable}, and includes versions of methods corresponding to each method
 * of {@code Hashtable}. However, even though all operations are thread-safe, retrieval operations do
 * <em>not</em> entail locking, and there is <em>not</em> any support for locking the entire table in a way
 * that prevents all access. This class is fully interoperable with {@code Hashtable} in programs that rely
 * on its thread safety but not on its synchronization details.
 *
 * <p> Retrieval operations (including {@code get}) generally do not block, so may overlap with update
 * operations (including {@code put} and {@code remove}). Retrievals reflect the results of the most
 * recently <em>completed</em> update operations holding upon their onset. For aggregate operations such as
 * {@code putAll} and {@code clear}, concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or removal of only some
 * entries. Similarly, Iterators and Enumerations return elements reflecting the state of the hash table at
 * some point at or since the creation of the iterator/enumeration. They do <em>not</em> throw
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}. However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a
 * time.
 *
 * <p> The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by the optional {@code concurrencyLevel}
 * constructor argument (default {@code 16}), which is used as a hint for internal sizing. The table is
 * internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated number of concurrent updates without contention.
 * Because placement in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will vary. Ideally, you
 * should choose a value to accommodate as many threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a
 * significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time, and a significantly lower value can lead
 * to thread contention. But overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do not usually have
 * much noticeable impact. A value of one is appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and
 * all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of hash table is a relatively slow
 * operation, so, when possible, it is a good idea to provide estimates of expected table sizes in
 * constructors.
 *
 * <p> This class and its views and iterators implement all of the <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Map}
 * and {@link Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p> Like {@link Hashtable} but unlike {@link HashMap}, this class does <em>not</em> allow {@code null} to
 * be used as a key or value.
 *
 * <p> This class is a member of the <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html"> Java
 * Collections Framework</a>.

       * any bin. The operations must not take any action that could even momentarily cause a concurrent
       * read operation to see inconsistent data. This is made easier by the nature of the read operations
       * in Map. For example, no operation can reveal that the table has grown but the threshold has not yet
       * been updated, so there are no atomicity requirements for this with respect to reads.
